# Assignment 2 - *HealthFinder++*

**HealthFinder** is a mobile client app that leverages the [HealthFinder API](https://healthfinder.gov/Developer/How_to_Use.aspx#) which is maintained by the Department of Health and Human Services.

Time spent: **X** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] User can search for HealthFinder topics using a UISearchBar
- [x] User can show and hide filter controls using a UISwitch
- [x] User can use a UIPickerView to select an age
- [x] Delegates/Protocols are used to update the searching functionality

The following **optional** features are implemented:
- [ ] Disable and clear the searchBar appropriately
- [ ] User can persist the filter options using `UserDefaults.standard`
- [ ] Improve the searching to be more robust by clearing results when you turn filters off
- [ ] Throttle the search function!

## Notes

Ran into an issue from the forked repo, podfiles weren't being read properly. Also copied the wrong API code from the Healthfinder website, as they post a diff code than what Sherman used. A bit of head scratching later, and I copied it from the video.
